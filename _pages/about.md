I am second year PhD student in biostatistics at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto. My research interests include causal inference, Bayesian methods and their application to observational data. Following my first year of PhD students, I joined [PyMC](https://docs.pymc.io/en/stable/) as a Google Summer of Code student where I worked on developing a Dirichlet Process submodule for the package. 

I am part of the [Health Data Working Group](https://health-data-working-group.github.io/), a new initiative from some of my peers, professors and myself to provide technical workshops for members of our public health research community. As of October 2021, I am also happy to serve as a GitHub Campus Expert and I hope to lead a series of tutorials on Git and GitHub.

Previously, I have pursued a dual Master's degree: one in biostatistics at McGill University and one in Public Health at the University of Bordeaux. I was jointly supervised by [Dr. Erica Moodie](https://www.ericamoodie.com/) and [Dr. Rodolphe Thi√©baut](https://www.bordeaux-population-health.center/profile/rodolphe-thiebaut/), both of whom I look up to greatly and attribute a lot of my personal and professional growth.

I also enjoy coding in Python, skateboarding and eating copious amounts of fruit (especially grapes, bananas, oranges and watermelon). Feel free to connect with me!
